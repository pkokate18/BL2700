# Command line activity

## Log on to colossus using terminal or putty

Hostname: `colossus.it.mtu.edu`  
Username: Your MTU ID
Password: Your MTU passowrd
*Note: Your password will not show up when typing*

## Log on to Filezilla
Hostname: `colossus.it.mtu.edu`  
Username: Your MTU ID

Port: 22
Then click Quickconnect

## Pracice Unix activity

### Determine your username

```{BASH}
whoami
```
### Determine your current working directory (Path)
```{BASH}
pwd
```
### Determine what files and directories are your working directory
```{BASH}
ls
```
### Make a new directory
```{BASH}
mkdir BL2700
```
### Change directoriees
```{BASH}
cd BL2700
```

# Unix Filters Activity

## Download fileÂ 
1. Log onto colossus
```{BASH}
cd Desktop
mkdir BL2700_data
cd BL2700_data
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stechtmann/BL2700/master/data/Loki_protein.fasta
```

## Navigate to the BL2700_data
```{BASH}
cd Desktop
cd BL2700_data
```
## Look at the first few lines of this file.
```{BASH}
head Loki_protein.fasta
```

## Look at the last few lines of this file.
```{BASH}
tail Loki_protein.fasta
```

## List all of the sequence names from this genome
```{BASH}
grep ">" Loki_protein.fasta
```

## Count the number of sequences in this fasta file.
```{BASH}
grep -c ">" Loki_protein.fasta
```

## List all of the sequence names that are hypothetical proteins from this genome
```{BASH}
grep "hypothetical protein" Loki_protein.fasta
```

**On your own - Count all of the proteins that are hypothetical proteins.**

## Creat a file with all of the names of proteins with tranferase in the name
```{BASH}
grep "transferase" Loki_protein.fasta > T_names.txt
```
## Remove the `>` and gene IDs from the names of the transferase genes and save as a new file.
```{BASH}
cut -d ' ' -f 2- T_names.txt > T_only_names.txt
```

## Use `uniq` to determine if there are any duplicated genes in the same transerase group.
```{BASH}
uniq T_only_names.txt -c
```

## Sort the names of the transferases to be in order
```{BASH}
sort T_only_names.txt
```

## Use a pipe to connect the sort and uniq commands to determine if there are duplicate names
```{BASH}
sort T_only_names.txt | uniq -c
```
**How could you make this easier to identify which groups have more than one gene?**


**In groups - Use a series of pipe (`|`) to create a determine if which groups of dehydrogenases have more than one gene.**
